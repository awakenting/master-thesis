  abstract  = {Escape maneuvers are essential to the survival and fitness of many animals. Escapes are frequently initiated when an animal is already in motion. This may introduce constraints that alter the escape performance. In fish, escape maneuvers and steady, body caudal fin (BCF) swimming are driven by distinct patterns of curvature of the body axis. Pre-existing muscle activity may therefore delay or diminish a response. To quantify the performance consequences of escaping in flow, escape behavior was examined in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) in both still-water and during steady swimming. Escapes executed during swimming were kinematically less variable than those made in still-water. Swimming escapes also had increased response latencies and lower peak velocities and accelerations than those made in still-water. Performance was also lower for escapes made up rather than down-stream, and a preference for down-stream escapes may be associated with maximizing performance. The constraints imposed by pre-existing motion and flow, therefore, have the potential to shape predator--prey interactions under field conditions by shifting the optimal strategies for both predators and prey.},

We reveal the existence of major group-level behavioural transitions related to minor changes in individual-level interactions. Further, we present the first evidence for collective memory in such animal groups (where the previous history of group structure influences the collective behaviour exhibited as individual interactions change) during the transition of a group from one type of collective behaviour to another. The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure, and how individuals employing simple, local rules of thumb, can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole. These results are considered in the context of the evolution and ecological importance of animal groups.},

  abstract  = {Escape responses are used by most fish species in order to avoid predation. Escape responses include a number of behavioral and kinematic components, such as responsiveness, reaction distance, escape latency, directionality, and distance-derived performance. All of these components can contribute to escape success. Work on the context-dependent variability has focused on reaction distance, and suggests that this component is largely determined by the relative cost and benefits of escaping (economic hypothesis). For example, reaction distance was found to depend on many factors related to perceived risk and cost of escaping, such as the attack speed and size of the predators, the proximity to refuges, and engagement in other activities (e.g., feeding). Evidence from many behavioral, kinematic, and physiological studies suggest that performance in other components of the escape response is also not always maximized. For example, escape latencies may increase in the presence of schooling neighbors, and escape speed is higher in fish that have been subject to higher predation pressure. In addition, all escape components are further modulated by the effect of environmental factors. Variability in escape components can be interpreted by using both ultimate and proximate explanations, for example, the effect of stimulus strength on escape latency can be interpreted as the triggering neural threshold varying with stimulus strength (proximate explanation) and high intensity stimuli representing higher risk to the prey (ultimate explanation). An integrative approach is suggested for a full, ecologically relevant, assessment of escape performance in fish. J. Exp. Zool. 313A:59–79, 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract        = {Coordination among social animals requires rapid and efficient transfer of information among individuals, which may depend crucially on the underlying structure of the communication network. Establishing the decision-making circuits and networks that give rise to individual behavior has been a central goal of neuroscience. However, the analogous problem of determining the structure of the communication network among organisms that gives rise to coordinated collective behavior, such as is exhibited by schooling fish and flocking birds, has remained almost entirely neglected. Here, we study collective evasion maneuvers, manifested through rapid waves, or cascades, of behavioral change (a ubiquitous behavior among taxa) in schooling fish (Notemigonus crysoleucas). We automatically track the positions and body postures, calculate visual fields of all individuals in schools of ∼150 fish, and determine the functional mapping between socially generated sensory input and motor response during collective evasion. We find that individuals use simple, robust measures to assess behavioral changes in neighbors, and that the resulting networks by which behavior propagates throughout groups are complex, being weighted, directed, and heterogeneous. By studying these interaction networks, we reveal the (complex, fractional) nature of social contagion and establish that individuals with relatively few, but strongly connected, neighbors are both most socially influential and most susceptible to social influence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can predict complex cascades of behavioral change at their moment of initiation, before they actually occur. Consequently, despite the intrinsic stochasticity of individual behavior, establishing the hidden communication networks in large self-organized groups facilitates a quantitative understanding of behavioral contagion.},

  abstract     = {We discuss the collective dynamics of self-propelled particles with selective attraction and repulsion interactions. Each particle, or individual, may respond differently to its neighbours depending on the sign of their relative velocity. Thus, it is able to distinguish approaching (coming closer) and retreating (moving away) individuals. This differentiation of the social response is motivated by the response to looming visual stimuli and may be seen as a generalization of the previously proposed escape and pursuit interactions motivated by empirical evidence for cannibalism as a driving force of collective migration in locusts and Mormon crickets. The model can account for different types of behaviour such as pure attraction, pure repulsion or escape and pursuit, depending on the values (signs) of the different response strengths. It provides, in the light of recent experimental results, an interesting alternative to previously proposed models of collective motion with an explicit velocity-alignment interaction. We discuss the derivation of a coarse-grained description of the system dynamics, which allows us to derive analytically the necessary condition for emergence of collective motion. Furthermore, we analyse systematically the onset of collective motion and clustering in numerical simulations of the model for varying interaction strengths. We show that collective motion arises only in a subregion of the parameter space, which is consistent with the analytical prediction and corresponds to an effective escape and/or pursuit response.},

Animal models with altered connections of the vestibular ear, and thus altered gravity sensation, would allow the examination of the effects of microgravity and how various countermeasures can establish normal function. We describe an experimental apparatus to monitor the effects of ear manipulations to generate asymmetric gravity input on the tadpole escape response. To perform the movement pattern analysis, an imaging apparatus was developed that uses a high-speed camera to obtain time-resolved, high-resolution images of tadpole movements. Movements were recorded in a temperature-controlled test chamber following mechanical stimulation with a solenoid actuator, to elicit a C-start response. Temperature within the test cell was controlled with a recirculating water bath. Xenopus laevis embryos were obtained using a standard fertilization technique. Tadpole response to a controlled perturbation was recorded in unprecedented detail and the approach was validated by describing the distinct differences in response between normal and one-eared tadpoles. The experimental apparatus and methods form an important element of a rigorous investigation into the response of the tadpole vestibular system to mechanical and biochemical manipulations, and can ultimately contribute to improved understanding of the effects of altered gravity perception on humans.},

We report that the visual system alone can recruit lateralized, rapid escape motor programs, similar to those elicited by mechanosensory modalities. Two-photon calcium imaging of retino-recipient midbrain regions isolated the optic tectum as an important center processing looming stimuli, with ensemble activity encoding the critical image size determining escape latency. Furthermore, we describe activity in retinal ganglion cell terminals and superficial inhibitory interneurons in the tectum during looming and propose a model for how temporal dynamics in tectal periventricular neurons might arise from computations between these two fundamental constituents. Finally, laser ablations of hindbrain circuitry confirmed that visual and mechanosensory modalities share the same premotor output network. We establish a circuit for the processing of aversive stimuli in the context of an innate visual behavior.},

Startle responses have been identified in a broad range of species across animal diversity. For investigations of neural circuit structure and function, these behaviors offer a number of benefits, including that they are driven by large and identifiable neurons and their neural control is simple in comparison to other behaviors. Among vertebrates, the best-known startle circuit is the Mauthner cell circuit of fishes. In recent years, genetic approaches in zebrafish have provided key tools for morphological and physiological dissection of circuits and greatly extended understanding of their architecture. Here we discuss the startle circuit of fishes, with a focus on the Mauthner cells and associated interneurons called spiral fiber neurons and we add new observations on hindbrain circuit organization. We also briefly review and compare startle circuits of several other taxa, paying particular attention to how movement direction is controlled.},

Typical latencies are \&gt;1.5 s, which is much longer than neuronal transduction processes. What mechanisms underlie these long latencies? We propose two alternative, biologically inspired models that could account for this latency to initiate swimming: an integrate and fire model, which is history dependent, and a stochastic Poisson model, which has no history dependence. We use these models to predict the behavior of larvae when presented with whole-field motion of varying speed and find that the stochastic process shows better agreement with the experimental data.

   impeded by the enormous complexity of the vertebrate brain, particularly
   the mammalian brain, as well as by the relative complexity of the
   behavioral alterations examined in most studies of long-term memory in
   vertebrates. Here, we demonstrate a long-term form of nonassociative
   learning specifically, long-term habituation (LTH) of a simple reflexive
   escape response, the C-start, in zebrafish larvae. The C-start is
   triggered by the activation of one of a pair of giant neurons in the
   zebrafish's hindbrain, the Mauthner cells. We show that LTH of the
   C-start requires the activity of NMDA receptors and involves
   macromolecular synthesis. We further show that the long-term habituated
   reflex can by rapidly dishabituated by a brief tactile stimulus. Our
   results set the stage for rigorous, mechanistic investigations of the
   long-term memory for habituation of a reflexive behavioral response, one
   that is mediated by a relatively simple, neurobiologically tractable,
   neural circuit. Moreover, the demonstration of NMDAR and

   How can sensory input initiate organized movements, activating all

   usually results in the activation of reticulospinal pathways. Young
   Xenopus tadpoles can respond to head-skin touch by swimming, which may
   start on either side. We investigate how motor networks in the brain are
   organized, and whether asymmetries in touch sensory pathways avoid
   co-activation of antagonists at the same time as producing co-ordinated
   movements. We record from key reticulospinal neurons in the network
   controlling swimming. When the head skin is stimulated unilaterally,
   excitation builds up slowly and asymmetrically in these neurons such
   that those on both sides do not fire synchronously. This build-up of
   excitation to threshold is the key decision-making step and determines
   whether swimming will start, as well as on which side. In response to
   stronger stimuli, the stimulated side tends to `win' because excitation
   from a shorter, trigeminal nucleus pathway becomes reliable and can
   initiate swimming earlier on the stimulated side. When this pathway
   fails or is lesioned, swimming starts later and on the unstimulated
   side. Stochasticity in the trigeminal nucleus pathway allows
   unpredictable turning behaviour to weaker stimuli, conferring potential
   survival benefits. We locate the longer, commissural sensory pathway
   carrying excitation to the unstimulated side and record from its
   neurons. These neurons fire to head-skin stimuli but excite
   reticulospinal neurons indirectly. We propose that asymmetries in the

   neurons, which project to the M-cell axon hillock. By in vivo calcium
   imaging, we found that spiral fiber neurons are active in response to
   aversive stimuli capable of eliciting escapes. Like M-cell ablations,
   bilateral ablations of spiral fiber neurons largely eliminate
   short-latency escapes. Unilateral spiral fiber neuron ablations shift
   the directionality of escapes and indicate that spiral fiber neurons
   excite the M-cell in a lateralized manner. Their optogenetic activation
   increases the probability of short-latency escapes, supporting the
   notion that spiral fiber neurons help activate M-cell-mediated startle

   avoidance behavior in Xenopus tadpoles as a model for stimulus

   it regulated the amount of integration between direct inputs from the
   retina and recurrent inputs from the tectum. Both pharmacological
   suppression and enhancement of synaptic inhibition disrupted emergent

   occurs when the organism perceives a threat. The M-cell has been
   extensively studied in adult goldfish where it has been shown to receive
   a wide range of excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory signals(1).
   We have been examining M-cell activity in embryonic zebrafish in order
   to study aspects of synaptic development in a vertebrate preparation. In
   the late 1990s Ali and colleagues developed a preparation for patch
   clamp recording from M-cells in zebrafish embryos, in which the CNS was
   largely intact(2,3,4). The objective at that time was to record synaptic
   activity from hindbrain neurons, spinal cord neurons and trunk skeletal
   muscle while maintaining functional synaptic connections within an
   intact brain-spinal cord preparation. This preparation is still used in
   our laboratory today. To examine the mechanisms underlying developmental
   synaptic plasticity, we record excitatory (AMPA and NMDA-mediated) 5,6
   and inhibitory (GABA and glycine) synaptic currents from developing
   M-cells. Importantly, this unique preparation allows us to return to the
   same cell (M-cell) from preparation to preparation to carefully examine
   synaptic plasticity and neuro-development in an embryonic organism. The
   benefits provided by this preparation include 1) intact, functional
   synaptic connections onto the M-cell, 2) relatively inexpensive
   preparations, 3) a large supply of readily available embryos 4) the

  abstract             = {{Goldfish are known to exhibit motor asymmetry due to functional
   asymmetry of their Mauthner neurons that induce the turns to the right
   or left during free swimming. It has been previously found that if the
   less active neuron is subjected to prolonged aimed visual stimulation
   via its ventral dendrite, the motor asymmetry of goldfish is inverted,
   testifying that this neuron becomes functionally dominant, while the
   size of the ventral dendrite under these conditions is reduced 2 - 3
   times compared to its counterpart in mirror neuron. Earlier it has been
   also revealed that training optokinetic stimulation induces adaptation,
   a substantial resistance of both fish motor asymmetry and
   morphofunctional state of Mauthner neurons against prolonged optokinetic
   stimulation. The aim of this work was to study the cellular mechanisms
   of the effect of an unusual visual afferent input on goldfish motor
   asymmetry and Mauthner neuron function in norm and under adaptation. It
   was shown that serotonin applied onto Mauthner neurons greatly reduces
   their activity whereas its antagonist ondansetron increases it. Against
   the background of visual stimulation, serotonin strengthens functional
   asymmetry between neurons whereas ondansetron smoothes it. Taken
   together these data suggest the involvement of serotonergic excitatory
   synaptic transmission in the regulation of Mauthner neurons by vision.
   Ultrastructural study of the ventral dendrites after prolonged
   optokinetic stimulation has revealed depletions of numeral axo-axonal
   synapses with specific morphology, identified by means of immunogold
   label as serotonergic ones. These latter in turn are situated mainly on
   shaft boutons, which according to specific ultrastructural features are
   assigned to axo-dendritic inhibitory synapses. Thus, the excitatory
   serotonergic synapses seem to affect Mauthner neuron indirectly through
   inhibitory synapses. Further, it was morphometrically established that
   adaptation is accompanied by the significant decrease of active zones
   dimensions in both serotonergic and inhibitory synapses. Finally, it was
   determined in model experiments that the interaction of globular actin
   with glycine, a main inhibitory neurotransmitter supposedly directly and
   chronically affecting the ventral dendrite, results in actin filaments
   formation. It is assumed that glycine-induced cytosolic actin
   polymerization is a cause of reduction in the ventral dendrite size
   under stimulation. Thus, it was established that a rather small group of
   synapses situated on an individual dendrite of the neuron determines the
   execution of the important form of animal behavior.}},

   open field the fish reliably turns away from the sound source. This
   implies that the M-cells are capable of a decision-making process that
   requires the two cells to receive differential directional inputs.
   Recent studies have indicated that the lateral line (LL) system is
   necessary in the initial directionality of the escape. This information
   is thought to be transmitted to the M-cell by the anterior branch of the
   lateral line nerve (aLLn), which has a shorter conduction time then the
   posterior branch. This study is the first attempt to characterize the
   inputs from the aLLn to the M-cell. M-cell intracellular responses to
   aLLn stimulation indicate a fast monosynaptic input (0.80 +/- 0.03 ms)
   that has a small amplitude averaging 5.85 +/- 0.42 mV. This input is
   bilateral and has a significantly longer latency and smaller amplitude
   in the contralateral M-cell. Superimposed on the evoked excitatory
   postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is a shunting inhibition with a delay of 1
   ms, which is characteristic of other sensory inputs to the M-cell.
   Pharmacological manipulation and 50 Hz stimulation reveal a component of
   the evoked EPSP that is electrotonic, a property favoring speed of
   transmission. In addition, this input is localized to the lateral
   dendrite proximal to the inputs from the inner ear. The short latency of
   these inputs and their proximity to the posterior eighth nerve afferents
   indicate a crucial role for the aLLn in influencing the excitability and
   directionality of the M-cell.}},

  abstract = {Summary Avoiding the strike of an approaching predator requires rapid visual detection of a looming object, followed by a directed escape maneuver. While looming-sensitive neurons have been discovered in various animal species, the relative importance of stimulus features that are extracted by the visual system is still unclear. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms that compute object approach are largely unknown. We found that a virtual looming stimulus, i.e., a dark expanding disk on a bright background, reliably evoked rapid escape movements. Related stimuli, such as dimming, receding, or bright looming objects, were substantially less effective, and angular size was a critical determinant of escape initiation. Two-photon calcium imaging in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons revealed three retinorecipient areas that responded robustly to looming stimuli. One of these areas, the optic tectum, is innervated by a subset of RGC axons that respond selectively to looming stimuli. Laser-induced lesions of the tectal neuropil impaired the behavior. Our findings demonstrate a visually mediated escape behavior in zebrafish larvae exposed to objects approaching on a collision course. This response is sensitive to spatiotemporal parameters of the looming stimulus. Our data indicate that a subset of RGC axons within the tectum responds selectively to features of looming stimuli and that this input is necessary for visually evoked escape.},

  abstract  = {Although behavior is ultimately guided by decision-making neurons and their associated networks, the mechanisms underlying neural decision-making in a behaviorally relevant context remain mostly elusive. To address this question, we analyzed goldfish escapes in response to distinct visual looming stimuli with high-speed video and compared them with electrophysiological responses of the Mauthner cell (M-cell), the threshold detector that initiates such behaviors. These looming stimuli evoke powerful and fast body-bend (C-start) escapes with response probabilities between 0.7 and 0.91 and mean latencies ranging from 142 to 716 ms. Chronic recordings showed that these C-starts are correlated with M-cell activity. Analysis of response latency as a function of the different optical parameters characterizing the stimuli suggests response threshold is closely correlated to a dynamically scaled function of angular retinal image size, θ(t), specifically κ(t) = θ(t - δ {\texttimes} e-βθ(t - δ), where the exponential term progressively reduces the weight of θ(t). Intracellular recordings show that looming stimuli typically evoked bursts of graded EPSPs with peak amplitudes up to 9 mV in the M-cell. The proposed scaling function κ(t) predicts the slope of the depolarizing envelope of these EPSPs and the timing of the largest peak. An analysis of the firing rate of presynaptic inhibitory interneurons suggests the timing of the EPSP peak is shaped by an interaction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the M-cell and corresponds to the temporal window in which the probabilistic decision of whether or not to escape is reached.},

However, animals possess a multitude of threat detection mechanisms, from hardwired circuits that ensure innate responses to predator cues, to the use of social information. Surprisingly, only more recently have these circuits captured the attention of a wider range of researchers working on different species and behavioural paradigms. These have shed new light into the mechanisms of threat detection revealing conservation of the kinds of cues animals use and of its underlying detection circuits across vertebrates. As most of these studies focus on single cues, we argue for the need to study multisensory integration, a process that we believe is determinant for the prey's defence responses.},

  abstract = {Predator pressure and olfactory cues (alarm substance) have been shown to modulate Mauthner cell (M-cell) initiated startle escape responses (C-starts) in teleost fish. The regulation of such adaptive responses to potential threats is thought to involve the release of steroid hormones such as cortisol. However, the mechanism by which cortisol may regulate M-cell excitability is not known. Here, we used intrasomatic, in vivo recordings to elucidate the acute effects of cortisol on M-cell membrane properties and sound evoked post-synaptic potentials (PSPs). Cortisol tonically decreased threshold current in the M-cell within 10 minutes before trending towards baseline excitability over an hour later, which may indicate the involvement of non-genomic mechanisms. Consistently, current ramp injection experiments showed that cortisol increased M-cell input resistance in the depolarizing membrane, i.e., by a voltage-dependent postsynaptic mechanism. Cortisol also increases the magnitude of sound-evoked M-cell PSPs by reducing the efficacy of local feedforward inhibition. Interestingly, another pre-synaptic inhibitory network mediating prepulse inhibition (PPI) remained unaffected. Together, our results suggest that cortisol rapidly increases M-cell excitability via a post-synaptic effector mechanism, likely a chloride conductance, which, in combination with its dampening effect on feedforward inhibition, will modulate information processing to reach threshold. Given the central role of the M-cell in initiating startle, these results are consistent with a role of cortisol in mediating the expression of a vital behavior.},

Contrasting this view, a special class of auditory afferents to teleost Mauthner cells, a command neuron that organizes tail-flip escape responses, undergoes potentiation of their mixed (electrical and chemical) synapses in response to high frequency cellular activity. This property is likely to represent a mechanism of input sensitization as these neurons provide the Mauthner cell with essential information for the initiation of an escape response. We review here the anatomical and physiological specializations of these identifiable auditory afferents. In particular, we discuss how their membrane and synaptic properties act in concert to more efficaciously activate the Mauthner cells. The striking functional specializations of these neurons suggest that primary auditory afferents might be capable of more sophisticated contributions to auditory processing than has been generally recognized.},

This selectivity is required for adaptive collision avoidance behavior in this species, but its underlying mechanisms are not known. In particular, it is still unclear how the balance between the recurrent spontaneous network activity and the newly arriving sensory flow is set in this structure, and to what degree this balance is important for collision detection. Also, despite the clear indication for the presence of strong recurrent excitation and spontaneous activity, the exact topology of recurrent feedback circuits in the tectum remains elusive. In this study we take advantage of recently published detailed cell-level data from tadpole tectum to build an informed computational model of it, and investigate whether dynamic activation in excitatory recurrent retinotopic networks may on its own underlie collision detection. We consider several possible recurrent connectivity configurations and compare their performance for collision detection under different levels of spontaneous neural activity. We show that even in the absence of inhibition, a retinotopic network of quickly inactivating spiking neurons is naturally selective for looming stimuli, but this selectivity is not robust to neuronal noise and is sensitive to the balance between direct and recurrent inputs. We also describe how homeostatic modulation of intrinsic properties of individual tectal cells can change selectivity thresholds in this network, and qualitatively verify our predictions in a behavioral experiment in freely swimming tadpoles.},

The ability to locate the M-cell, along with its inputs and outputs, has resulted in important findings in diverse areas of neurobiology including the molecular biology of neurons, synaptic and systems physiology, behavior, development, and neuroethology. The review provides a brief overview of the M-cell and then focuses on recent studies applying state-of-the-art techniques to address new issues and revisit old ones. One advantage of this preparation is the ability to conduct multidisciplinary studies from the subcellular to behavioral levels. For example, studies of activity-dependent changes in the strength of mixed electrotonic and chemical synapses on the M-cell's lateral dendrite in vivo have been correlated with changes in the probability of eliciting a fast startle response initiated by the M-cell and its associated circuits. Similarly, it is now possible to image the activity of the M-cell and its homologs while observing motor behavior in zebrafish larvae. These approaches will provide direct tests of the functional properties of complex neural networks. Moreover, molecular mechanisms that underlie neuronal development can be tested directly with this neuron and its segmental homologs, because these cells occur in singular pairs at defined locations. Finally, after spinal cord injury, the M-cell's axon regenerates, but does not follow its original course, and the startle response gradually recovers. The accessibility of the M-cell system offers the promise that strategies employed in restoring the function of a neural network will be revealed. Thus, we anticipate that the M-cell system will become a favored preparation for multidisciplinary studies on the neuronal basis of behavior and the recovery of behavior after injury.

  abstract = {Abstract Escape is among the simplest animal behaviors employed to study the neural mechanisms underlying learning. Teleost fishes exhibit behavioral learning of fast escape initiated with a C-shaped body bend (C-start). C-starts are subdivided into short-latency (SLC) and long-latency (LLC) types in larval zebrafish. Whether these two can be separately modified, and the neural correlates of this modification, however, remains undetermined. We thus performed Ca2+ imaging of Mauthner (M-) cells, a pair of giant hindbrain neurons constituting a core element of SLC circuit, during behavioral learning in larval zebrafish. The Ca2+ response corresponding to a single spiking of the M-cells was coupled with SLCs but not LLCs. Conditioning with a repeated weak sound at subthreshold intensity to elicit C-starts selectively suppressed SLC occurrence for 10min without affecting LLC responsiveness. The short-term desensitization of SLC was associated with the suppression of M-cell activity, suggesting that changes in single neuron responsiveness mediate behavioral learning. The conditioning did not affect the acoustically evoked mechanotransduction of inner ear hair cells, further suggesting plastic change in transmission efficacy within the auditory input circuit between the hair cells and the M-cell.},

  abstract = {Summary Exposure to repetitive startling stimuli induces habitation, a simple form of learning. Despite its simplicity, the precise cellular mechanisms by which repeated stimulation converts a robust behavioral response to behavioral indifference are unclear. Here, we use head-restrained zebrafish larvae to monitor subcellular Ca2+ dynamics in Mauthner neurons, the startle command neurons, during startle habituation in vivo. Using the Ca2+ reporter GCaMP6s, we find that the amplitude of Ca2+ signals in the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner neuron determines startle probability and that depression of this dendritic activity rather than downstream inhibition mediates glycine and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor-dependent short-term habituation. Combined, our results suggest a model for habituation learning in which increased inhibitory drive from feedforward inhibitory neurons combined with decreased excitatory input from auditory afferents decreases dendritic and Mauthner neuron excitability.},

  abstract = { Heterogeneous, “aggregated” patterns in the spatial distributions of individuals are almost universal across living organisms, from bacteria to higher vertebrates. Whereas specific features of aggregations are often visually striking to human eyes, a heuristic analysis based on human vision is usually not sufficient to answer fundamental questions about how and why organisms aggregate. What are the individual-level behavioral traits that give rise to these features? When qualitatively similar spatial patterns arise from purely physical mechanisms, are these patterns in organisms biologically significant, or are they simply epiphenomena that are likely characteristics of any set of interacting autonomous individuals? If specific features of spatial aggregations do confer advantages or disadvantages in the fitness of group members, how has evolution operated to shape individual behavior in balancing costs and benefits at the individual and group levels? Mathematical models of social behaviors such as schooling in fishes provide a promising avenue to address some of these questions. However, the literature on schooling models has lacked a common framework to objectively and quantitatively characterize relationships between individual-level behaviors and group-level patterns. In this paper, we briefly survey similarities and differences in behavioral algorithms and aggregation statistics among existing schooling models. We present preliminary results of our efforts to develop a modeling framework that synthesizes much of this previous work, and to identify relationships between behavioral parameters and group-level statistics. },

Due to the connectivity of the Mauthner cell axon at the cranial and spinal cord levels, the activation of this cell produces a tail flip, which constitutes the initial phase of the escape response.

The best-known examples of fast starts are escape responses and predator strikes. Escape responses are usually controlled by the Mauthner cells, while little is known about the neural control of predatory strikes. A typical escape response consists of a unilateral muscle contraction bending the fish into a C-shape (stage 1), followed by a contralateral muscle contraction (stage 2). In predator strikes, the body is usually bent into an S-shape at the end of stage 1. During fast starts, fish can reach speeds &gt; 10 Length s−1 and accelerations &gt; 100 m s−2. Here, fast starts are discussed in terms of their neural control, muscle activity, hydrodynamics, performance, kinematics, as well as the effect of environmental factors and body design. },

  abstract  = {Escape responses of fishes are one of the best characterized vertebrate behaviors, with extensive previous research on both the neural control and biomechanics of startle response performance. However, very little is known about the hydrodynamics of escape responses, despite the fact that understanding fluid flow patterns during the escape is critical for evaluating how body movement transfers power to the fluid, for defining the time course of power generation, and for characterizing the wake signature left by escaping fishes, which may provide information to predators. In this paper, we present an experimental hydrodynamic analysis of the C-start escape response in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). We used time-resolved digital particle image velocimetry at 1000 frames s{\textendash}1 (fps) to image flow patterns during the escape response. We analyzed flow patterns generated by the body separately from those generated by the dorsal and anal fins to assess the contribution of these median fins to escape momentum. Each escape response produced three distinct jets of fluid. Summing the components of fluid momentum in the jets provided an estimate of fish momentum that did not differ significantly from momentum measured from the escaping fish body. In contrast to conclusions drawn from previous kinematic analyses and theoretical models, the caudal fin generated momentum that opposes the escape during stage one, whereas the body bending during stage one contributed substantial propulsive momentum. Additionally, the dorsal and anal fins each contributed substantial momentum. The results underscore the importance of the dorsal and anal fins as propulsors and suggest that the size and placement of these fins may be a key determinant of fast start performance.},

A quantitative understanding of behaviour would therefore advance research in neuroscience as well as ecology and evolution. However, animal posture typically has many degrees of freedom and behavioural dynamics vary on timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, presenting both technical and conceptual challenges. Here we review 1) advances in imaging and computer vision that are making it possible to capture increasingly complete records of animal motion and 2) new approaches to understanding the resulting behavioural data sets. With the right analytical approaches, these data are allowing researchers to revisit longstanding questions about the structure and organisation of animal behaviour and to put unifying principles on a quantitative footing. Contributions from both experimentalists and theorists are leading to the emergence of a physics of behaviour and the prospect of discovering laws and developing theories with broad applicability. We believe that there now exists an opportunity to develop theories of behaviour which can be tested using these data sets leading to a deeper understanding of how and why animals behave.},

  abstract = {The circuit mechanisms that give rise to direction selectivity in the retina have been studied extensively but how direction selectivity is established in retinorecipient areas of the brain is less well understood. Using functional imaging in larval zebrafish we examine how the direction of motion is encoded by populations of neurons at three layers of the optic tectum; retinal ganglion cell axons (RGCs), a layer of superficial inhibitory interneurons (SINs) and periventricular neurons (PVNs), which constitute the majority of neurons in the tectum. We show that the representation of motion direction is transformed at each layer. At the level of RGCs and SINs the direction of motion is encoded by three direction-selective (DS) subtypes tuned to upward, downward and caudal-to-rostral motion. However the tuning of SINs is significantly narrower and this leads to a conspicuous gap in the representation of motion in the rostral-to-caudal direction at the level of SINs. Consistent with previous findings we demonstrate that, at the level of PVNs the direction of motion is encoded by four DS cell types with an additional DS PVN cell type tuned to rostral-to-caudal motion. Strikingly, the tuning profile of this emergent cell type overlaps with the gap in the representation of rostral-to-caudal motion at the level of SINs. Using our functional imaging data we constructed a simple computational model that demonstrates how the emergent population of PVNs is generated by the interactions of cells at each layer of the tectal network. The model predicts that PVNs tuned to rostral-to-caudal motion can be generated via convergence of DS RGCs tuned to upward and downward motion and feedforward tuned inhibition via SINs which suppresses responses to non-preferred directions. Thus, by reshaping directional tuning that is inherited from the retina inhibitory inputs from SINs can generate a novel subtype of DS PVN and in so doing enhance the encoding of directional stimuli.},

   Ecological context, sensory inputs, and the internal physiological state
   are all factors that need to be integrated for an animal to make
   appropriate behavioral decisions. However, these factors have rarely
   been studied in the same system. In the African cichlid fish
   Astatotilapia burtoni, males alternate between two phenotypes based on
   position in a social hierarchy. When dominant (DOM), fish display bright
   body coloration and a wealth of aggressive and reproductive behavioral
   patterns that make them conspicuous to predators. Subordinate (SUB)
   males, on the other hand, decrease predation risk by adopting cryptic
   coloration and schooling behavior. We therefore hypothesized that DOMs
   would show enhanced startleescape responsiveness to compensate for their
   increased predation risk. Indeed, behavioral responses to sound clicks
   of various intensities showed a significantly higher mean startle rate
   in DOMs compared with SUBs. Electrophysiological recordings from the
   Mauthner cells (M-cells), the neurons triggering startle, were performed
   in anesthetized animals and showed larger synaptic responses to sound
   clicks in DOMs, consistent with the behavioral results. In addition, the
   inhibitory drive mediated by interneurons (passive hyperpolarizing
   potential {[}PHP] cells) presynaptic to the M-cell was significantly
   reduced in DOMs. Taken together, the results suggest that the likelihood
   for an escape to occur for a given auditory stimulus is higher in DOMs
   because of a more excitable M-cell. More broadly, this study provides an
   integrative explanation of an ecological and social trade-off at the
   level of an identifiable decision-making neural circuit.}},

   stimulus and small responses away from caudal stimuli, suggesting that
   rostral startling stimuli recruit larger pools of reticulospinal neurons
   in the Brainstem Escape Network ( BEN) than do caudal stimuli.
   Consistent with this idea, the zebrafish Mauthner (M-) cell fires when
   the fish is startled by tail-directed stimuli, but the M- cell
   homologues (MiD2cm and MiD3cm) are also recruited when the fish is
   startled by displacing the head. Because vision is known to modulate M-
   cell activity, a nonstartling, modulatory sensory `signal' conveyed to
   the reticular formation may be stronger if the visual sensory image is
   from a rostral vs. caudal spatial location and could account for a
   differential neuron pool recruitment and response magnitude. In this
   study, electrophysiological recordings from cichlid Mauthner neurons
   showed that visual stimulation of the caudal retina (by a rostral cue)
   generates a depolarization that is about 1.5 times the amplitude of that
   generated by stimulation of the rostral retina (by a caudal cue). In
   behavioral testing, where fish were stimulated visually for 30 ms and
   then startled by sound, fish startled in the presence of a rostral
   visual stimulus performed larger amplitude and faster turns than when
   startled in the presence of a caudal visual stimulus. Thus, M- cell
   potentials might reflect the strength of visual input to the BEN in
   general. For a particular visual spatial location, the relative strength
   of descending visual input appears to contribute to a recruitment of a
   reticulospinal neuron population that generates a turn magnitude
   appropriate to the visual cue, and suggests that a retinotopic
   representation is preserved in the BEN. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG,

  abstract = {Fish are elusive prey with a short-latency escape behavior—the C-start—initiated to either the left or right by a “race” between 2 giant Mauthner neurons in the fish brainstem. Water disturbances usually excite the ipsilateral neuron, which massively excites contralateral motor neurons, resulting in a rapid turn away from striking predators. Here, it is reported that tentacled snakes (Erpeton tentaculatus) exploit this normally adaptive circuitry by feinting with their body, triggering the Mauthner cell that is furthest from their head milliseconds before a ballistic strike is initiated. As a result, fish that were oriented parallel to the long axis of the snake's head most often turned toward the approaching jaws, sometimes swimming directly into the snake's mouth. When strikes were instead directed at fish oriented at a right angle to the snake's head, snakes anticipated future fish behavior by striking to where fish would later be if they escaped from the snake's body feint, which fish usually did. The results provide an example of a rare predator taking advantage of a prey's normally adaptive escape circuitry and suggest that the snake's sensory-motor system is adapted to predict future behavior.},

  abstract  = {The adoption of postures as a response to threats is often interpreted in terms of predator detection or signalling (e.g. vigilance and defence display). The possibility that an alternative or additional function of anti-predator postures might be to enhance the subsequent escape has been largely unexplored. Here, we use black goby (Gobius niger) to test the hypothesis that a postural curvature caused by a bending response (i.e. a slow muscle contraction which bends the body with no forward displacement) induced by a weak stimulus (WS) may affect escape responses. Three experiments were carried out. (1) Control and WS-stimulated fish were startled using lateral mechanical stimuli, to test whether the orientation of the postural C-bend affected escape direction and performance. Postural curvature was defined as positive when escapes were towards the convex side of the postural C-shape, and negative when they were towards the concave side. Locomotor performance increased with postural curvature, although fish showed a preference for escaping away from the stimulus regardless of postural curvature. (2) Control and WS-stimulated fish were startled from above, hence minimising the directionality of the threat on the horizontal plane. WS-stimulated fish showed a bias towards escaping from a positive curvature, thereby enhancing their locomotor performance. (3) Field observations with stimuli coming from above showed that gobies escape most often towards the convex side of the postural C-shape. By escaping from positively curved postures, most of the initial tailsweep is directed backwards and may provide more thrust than when starting from straight or negatively curved postures. Hence, the anti-predator posture adopted by alerted benthic fishes may {\textquoteleft}prepare{\textquoteright} them for their subsequent escape response because it conveys an advantage when they are attacked from above (a likely occurrence), although when gobies are stimulated horizontally, escape direction may be favoured over high locomotor performance when the two trade off.},

  abstract  = {The paired teleost Mauthner (M)-cells and their associated network serve as an excellent system to study the biophysical basis of decision making. In teleosts, an abrupt sound evokes an M-spike, triggering a C-start escape that is usually directed away from a sound source. The response latency is minimized by electrical synapses between auditory afferents and the M-cell lateral dendrite. Here, we demonstrate that the electrical synapses also mediate phase encoding. Ramped sound pressure waves (150{\textendash}250 Hz) evoked electrotonic postsynaptic potentials in the M-cell locked to two diametrically opposed phase angles that were frequency dependent but intensity independent. Phase encoding was also evident at the behavioral level underwater, because the stimuli evoked directional C-starts with an onset that was phase locked to the sound wave. In interneurons inhibitory to the M-cell, these same stimuli also evoked phase-locked electrotonic postsynaptic potentials and action potentials. The resulting chemical and electrical (i.e., field effect) inhibitions functioned tonically and phasically, respectively. Phase encoding could be important in underwater sound source localization, which is thought to require a neural computation involving a phase comparison between the pressure and the directional particle motion components of sound. This computation may be implemented by an interplay between phase-dependent afferent excitation and feedforward inhibition that activates the appropriate M-cell and directs the C-start away from the sound source.},

  abstract  = {In a social group, animals make behavioral decisions that fit their social ranks. These behavioral choices are dependent on the various social cues experienced during social interactions. In vertebrates, little is known of how social status affects the underlying neural mechanisms regulating decision-making circuits that drive competing behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that social status in zebrafish (Danio rerio) influences behavioral decisions by shifting the balance in neural circuit activation between two competing networks (escape and swim). We show that socially dominant animals enhance activation of the swim circuit. Conversely, social subordinates display a decreased activation of the swim circuit, but an enhanced activation of the escape circuit. In an effort to understand how social status mediates these effects, we constructed a neurocomputational model of the escape and swim circuits. The model replicates our findings and suggests that social status{\textendash}related shift in circuit dynamics could be mediated by changes in the relative excitability of the escape and swim networks. Together, our results reveal that changes in the excitabilities of the Mauthner command neuron for escape and the inhibitory interneurons that regulate swimming provide a cellular mechanism for the nervous system to adapt to changes in social conditions by permitting the animal to select a socially appropriate behavioral response.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding how social factors influence nervous system function is of great importance. Using zebrafish as a model system, we demonstrate how social experience affects decision making to enable animals to produce socially appropriate behavior. Based on experimental evidence and computational modeling, we show that behavioral decisions reflect the interplay between competing neural circuits whose activation thresholds shift in accordance with social status. We demonstrate this through analysis of the behavior and neural circuit responses that drive escape and swim behaviors in fish. We show that socially subordinate animals favor escape over swimming, while socially dominants favor swimming over escape. We propose that these differences are mediated by shifts in relative circuit excitability.},

Using 3D histological reconstruction of the above cells, we measured the volumes of the right and left MNs and examined the ultrastructure of specialized synaptic compartments in excitatory synapses localized on the surface of the soma, lateral dendrite, and ventral dendrite of these cells. In the course of the experiments, control fishes remain ambidextrals, and the mean volumes of the right and left MNs in these individuals were close to each other. In a fish of this group, dimensions of the active zones (AZs) of chemical synapses localized on the lateral dendrite were considerably greater in the right neuron, while those in synapses on the lateral dendrite were smaller in the left neuron. Experimental fishes subjected to the above-mentioned procedures demonstrated clearly expressed motor lateralization; the mean volumes of their right and left MNs were, however, practically equal to each other. Ultrastructural analysis of peculiarities of MNs of such a fish showed that dimensions of the AZs in chemical synapses on the soma and lateral dendrite of the left MN, which became much less active functionally, significantly exceeded the analogous indices in synapses of the same localization on the right, more active, MN. In mixed synapses, the mean dimensions of gap junctions in control and experimental individuals were similar to each other independently of localization of such synapses. Interrelations between functional asymmetry of MNs manifested in lateralization of motor behavior of the fishes and dimensions of synaptic structures on these cells are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Escape responses are used by many animal species as their main defence against predator attacks. Escape success is determined by a number of variables; important are the directionality (the percentage of responses directed away from the threat) and the escape trajectories (ETs) measured relative to the threat. Although logic would suggest that animals should always turn away from a predator, work on various species shows that these away responses occur only approximately 50{\textendash}90\% of the time. A small proportion of towards responses may introduce some unpredictability and may be an adaptive feature of the escape system. Similar issues apply to ETs. Theoretically, an optimal ET can be modelled on the geometry of predator{\textendash}prey encounters. However, unpredictability (and hence high variability) in trajectories may be necessary for preventing predators from learning a simple escape pattern. This review discusses the emerging trends in escape trajectories, as well as the modulating key factors, such as the surroundings and body design. The main ET patterns identified are: (1) high ET variability within a limited angular sector (mainly 90{\textendash}180 deg away from the threat; this variability is in some cases based on multiple peaks of ETs), (2) ETs that allow sensory tracking of the threat and (3) ETs towards a shelter. These characteristic features are observed across various taxa and, therefore, their expression may be mainly related to taxon-independent animal design features and to the environmental context in which prey live {\textendash} for example whether the immediate surroundings of the prey provide potential refuges.},

In an initial series of behavioral experiments, we characterized the effects of a selective 5-HT5A antagonist, SB-699551 (3-cyclopentyl-N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-[(4'-{[(2-phenylethyl)amino]methyl}-4-biphenylyl)methyl]propanamide dihydrochloride), on prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. Those experiments showed a dose-dependent decline in startle rates in prepulse conditions. Subsequent behavioral experiments showed that SB-699551 also reduced baseline startle rates (i.e., without prepulse). To determine the cellular mechanisms underlying these behaviors, we tested the effects of two distinct selective 5-HT5A antagonists, SB-699551 and A-843277 (N-(2,6-dimethoxybenzyl)-N'[4-(4-fluorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl]guanidine), on the intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic sound response of the Mauthner cell (M-cell), the decision-making neuron of the startle circuit. Auditory-evoked postsynaptic potentials recorded in the M-cell were similarly attenuated after treatment with either 5-HT5A antagonist (SB-699551, 26.41 {\textpm} 3.98\% reduction; A-843277, 17.52 {\textpm} 6.24\% reduction). This attenuation was produced by a tonic (intrinsic) reduction in M-cell input resistance, likely mediated by a Cl- conductance, that added to the extrinsic inhibition produced by an auditory prepulse. Interestingly, the effector mechanisms underlying neural prepulse inhibition itself were unaffected by antagonist treatment. In summary, these results provide an in vivo electrophysiological characterization of the 5-HT5A receptor and its behavioral relevance and provide a new perspective on the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic modulatory mechanisms in startle plasticity and sensorimotor gating.},

  abstract = {Summary All visual animals must decide whether approaching objects are a threat. Our current understanding of this process has identified a proximity-based mechanism where an evasive maneuver is triggered when a looming stimulus passes a subtended visual angle threshold. However, some escape strategies are more costly than others, and so it would be beneficial to additionally encode the level of threat conveyed by the predator’s approach rate to select the most appropriate response. Here, using naturalistic rates of looming visual stimuli while simultaneously monitoring escape behavior and the recruitment of multiple reticulospinal neurons, we find that larval zebrafish do indeed perform a calibrated assessment of threat. While all fish generate evasive maneuvers at the same subtended visual angle, lower approach rates evoke slower, more kinematically variable escape responses with relatively long latencies as well as the unilateral recruitment of ventral spinal projecting nuclei (vSPNs) implicated in turning. In contrast, higher approach rates evoke faster, more kinematically stereotyped responses with relatively short latencies, as well as bilateral recruitment of vSPNs and unilateral recruitment of giant fiber neurons in fish and amphibians called Mauthner cells. In addition to the higher proportion of more costly, shorter-latency Mauthner-active responses to greater perceived threats, we observe a higher incidence of freezing behavior at higher approach rates. Our results provide a new framework to understand how behavioral flexibility is grounded in the appropriate balancing of trade-offs between fast and slow movements when deciding to respond to a visually perceived threat.},

  abstract = {Although it is accepted that extracellular fields generated by neuronal activity can influence the excitability of neighboring cells, whether this form of neurotransmission has a functional role remains open. In vivo field effects occur in the teleost Mauthner (M)-cell system, where a combination of structural features support the concept of inhibitory electrical synapses. A single spike in one M-cell evoked within as little as 2.2 ms of the onset of an abrupt sound, simulating a predatory strike, initiates a startle-escape behavior [Zottoli SJ (1977) J Exp Biol 66:243–254]. We show that such sounds produce synchronized action potentials in as many as 20 or more interneurons that mediate feed-forward electrical inhibition of the M-cell. The resulting action currents produce an electrical inhibition that coincides with the electrotonic excitatory drive to the M-cell; the amplitude of the peak of the inhibition is ≈40% of that of the excitation. When electrical inhibition is neutralized with an extracellular cathodal current pulse, subthreshold auditory stimuli are converted into ones that produce an M-spike. Because the timing of electrical inhibition is often the same as the latency of M-cell firing in freely swimming fish, we conclude that electrical inhibition participates in regulating the threshold of the acoustic startle-escape behavior. Therefore, a field effect is likely to be essential to the normal functioning of the neural network.},

The teleost C-start is triggered by an action potential in one of the two Mauthner (M) cells. To correlate C-start behavior with electrophysiology, extracellular recordings were obtained from the surface of the medulla oblongata in the hindbrain, close to the M-axons, in freely swimming goldfish monitored using high-speed video. The recordings included action potentials generated by the two M-axons, as well as neighboring axons in the dorsal medial longitudinal fasciculus. Axonal backfills indicated that the latter originate from identifiable reticulospinal somata in rhombomeres 2-8 and local interneurons. Diverse auditory and visual stimuli evoked behaviors with kinematics characteristic of the C-start, and the amplitude of the first component of the hindbrain field potential correlated with the C-start direction. The onset of the field potential preceded that of the simultaneously recorded trunk EMG and movement initiation by 1.08{\textpm}0.04 and 8.13{\textpm}0.17 ms, respectively. A subsequent longer latency field potential was predictive of a counterturn.

   contralateral to the compressive sound pulse, goldish continued to avoid
   the sound source; cichlids avoided the visual cue and turned toward the
   sound. Goldfish performance improved significantly when the visual cue
   was in the same direction as the sound source. Goldfish performance also
   improved significantly after exposure to 0.1 mmol l(-1) cobalt solution

   directly accelerates the ear but tends to reduce both the pressure
   changes transduced by the swimbladder and activation of the

When faced with a threat, animals make decisions in the midst of other ongoing behaviors through a context-dependent integration of sensory stimuli. In vertebrates, the mechanisms underlying behavioral selection are poorly understood. Here, we show that ongoing swimming in zebrafish is suppressed by escape. The selection of escape over swimming is mediated by switching between two distinct motoneuron pools. A hardwired circuit mediates this switch by acting as a clutch-like mechanism to disengage the swimming motoneuron pool and engage the escape motoneuron pool. Threshold for escape initiation is lowered and swimming suppression is prolonged by endocannabinoid neuromodulation. Thus, our results reveal a novel cellular mechanism involving a hardwired circuit supplemented with endocannabinoids acting as a clutch-like mechanism to engage/disengage distinct motor pools to ensure behavioral selection and a smooth execution of motor action sequences in a vertebrate system.},

  abstract  = {Activation of auditory afferents on the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner (M)-cell triggers an escape response (C-start) in goldfish. To study distinct behavioral changes and their physiological correlates on a cellular level we examined the effect of acute changes of temperature on M-cell membrane properties and intracellular responses to sound clicks and on C-start kinematics and behavior, focusing on threshold and initial escape direction, two properties determined on the M-cell level. Cooling slowed C-start motor performance, increasing response latency and decreasing peak velocity and peak acceleration, but increased the probability of triggering the escape. In addition, the likelihood of escapes in an inappropriate direction (e.g., responses toward the stimulus instead of away from it) increased at low temperatures. On a cellular level, cooling caused a distinct increase in input resistance of the M-cell and in the dendritic space constant for the auditory-evoked synaptic potentials. Moreover, cooling decreased the magnitude and delayed the onset of feedforward inhibition of the M-cell. These temperature-induced changes in the network and in the intrinsic M-cell properties combine to support behavioral hyperexcitability, but apparently also alter the directional decision-making process during an escape. More generally, our results illustrate that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory influences can determine the expression of a behavior and its modification and at the same time underline the significance of temperature for nervous system function and behavior.},

The artificial neural networks were trained with backpropagation to assign connectivity and receptive fields in an architecture consistent with the known anatomy of the Mauthner system. Our first goal was to develop neurally specific hypotheses for how the Mauthner system discriminates right from left in the onset of a sound. Our model was consistent with the phase model for directional hearing underwater, the prevalent theory for sound source localization by fishes. Our second goal was to demonstrate how the neural mechanisms that permit sound localization according to the phase model can coexist with the mechanisms that permit the Mauthner system to discriminate between stimuli based on amplitude. Our results indicate possible computational roles for elements of the Mauthner system, which has provided us a theoretical context within which to consider past and future experiments on the cellular physiology.

Based on the hypothesis that differences in M-cell size might be related to fish family and possibly fish habitat, M-cell and nuclear size were compared between fish families. In order to minimize effects of fish length on cell or nuclear size, statistical treatment of the data was made for four separate length classes. The results indicate at least three groupings by cell or nuclear size. The cell is large in fish from the Salmonidae, Catostomidae and Cyprinidae, small in the Stichaeidae, Cottidae and Pleuronectidae and absent in Batrachoididae, Lophiidae, Ogcocephalidae and Cyclopteridae. In general a correlation exists between fish that lack or have small M-cells and a demersal habitat. Since these fish may rely on camouflage for protection against predation, the M-cells may have altered excitability or function as compared to more active fish in which the M-cell is known to function in initiating the startle response (larval zebrafish and goldfish). Differences in input to M-cells of different sizes in conjunction with known electrophysiological properties of the goldfish M-cell are discussed in relation to the function of this neuron.},

  abstract = {This study addresses mechanisms for the generation and selection of visual behaviors in anamniotes. To demonstrate the function of these mechanisms, we have constructed an experimental platform where a simulated animal swims around in a virtual environment containing visually detectable objects. The simulated animal moves as a result of simulated mechanical forces between the water and its body. The undulations of the body are generated by contraction of simulated muscles attached to realistic body components. Muscles are driven by simulated motoneurons within networks of central pattern generators. Reticulospinal neurons, which drive the spinal pattern generators, are in turn driven directly and indirectly by visuomotor centers in the brainstem. The neural networks representing visuomotor centers receive sensory input from a simplified retina. The model also includes major components of the basal ganglia, as these are hypothesized to be key components in behavior selection. We have hypothesized that sensorimotor transformation in tectum and pretectum transforms the place-coded retinal information into rate-coded turning commands in the reticulospinal neurons via a recruitment network mimicking the layered structure of tectal areas. Via engagement of the basal ganglia, the system proves to be capable of selecting among several possible responses, even if exposed to conflicting stimuli. The anatomically based structure of the control system makes it possible to disconnect different neural components, yielding concrete predictions of how animals with corresponding lesions would behave. The model confirms that the neural networks identified in the lamprey are capable of responding appropriately to simple, multiple, and conflicting stimuli.},

  abstract = { Schooling behavior in fish has been recognized to confer antipredator advantages. However, the mechanisms that lead to various patterns of escape maneuvers in fish schools are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of startle stimulus characteristics (distance and orientation) on the escape maneuvers of schools of a highly gregarious fish species, the Atlantic herring Clupea harengus. We quantified information transfer of the onset of startle responses by analyzing the speed of the waves of their propagation (Uw = 6.7 ± 1.6 m/s; mean ± SD). Uw was found to be positively correlated with the number of early responders (i.e., individuals reacting with a latency <50 ms). In addition, we identified the rules determining two different evading maneuvers: highly aligned maneuvers (i.e., all individuals oriented in a relatively uniform direction) and “split” maneuvers (i.e., individuals escaping with low directional uniformity). The pattern of escape maneuvers was dependent on stimulus direction (αs). Lateral stimulation (30° < αs < 120°) elicits highly aligned maneuvers away from the stimulus, while frontal stimulations (αs < 30°) causes split maneuvers, which are followed by realignment about 1 s after stimulation. These simple rules suggest that certain stimulus characteristics are important factors determining the variability of antipredator maneuvers observable in schooling fish. },

  abstract = {The escape behaviour of solitary herring (Clupea harengus L.) startled by a sound stimulus was observed by means of high-speed video-filming. The results were compared with data from a previous study on the escape behaviour of schooling herring. Escape responses were divided into ``away responses'' and ``towards responses'' according to the orientation of the C-bend of the body relative to the stimulus. The proportion of away responses was smaller for solitary than for schooling herring. In solitary herring, the subsequent escape trajectories of fish making initial away responses showed a bimodal pattern of distribution, with modes at 130 and 180{\textdegree} from the stimulus. Trajectories following towards responses, however, were mainly within the semicircle directed at the stimulus, and their pattern of distribution differed from that of away responses. This result contrasts with observations on schooling herring, whose trajectories following both initial away and towards responses are directed away from the stimulus. In addition, we measured the response latency, defined as the interval of time between stimulus presentation and the first detectable movement of the fish. Solitary herring showed a higher proportion of short-latency responses (latency <50{\thinspace}ms) than schooling herring. Different behaviours appear to be exhibited by herring depending on whether they are solitary or within a school. We hypothesize that schooling may raise the threshold for initiation of fast escape responses, giving longer latencies and slower responses which are more appropriate in their directionality and reduce the possibility of collisions with neighbours. In addition, we suggest that schooling behaviour enhances the directionality and co-ordination of the escape response of the whole school, possibly increasing the probability of surviving a predator attack.},

  abstract  = {Teleost and amphibian prey undertake fast-start escape responses during a predatory attack in an attempt to avoid being captured. Although previously viewed as a reflex reaction controlled by the autonomic nervous system, the escape responses of individuals when repeatedly startled are highly variable in their characteristics, suggesting some behavioural mediation of the response. Previous studies have shown that fishes are able to learn from past experiences, but few studies have assessed how past experience with predators affect the fast-start response. Here we determined whether prior experience with the smell or sight of a predator (the Dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus) affected the escape response of juveniles of the Spiny Chromis (Acanthochromis polyacanthus). Results show that individuals exposed to any of the predator cues prior to being startled exhibited a stronger escape response (i.e., reduced latency, increased escape distance, mean response speed, maximum response speed and maximum acceleration) when compared with controls. This study demonstrates the plasticity of escape responses and highlights the potential for naïve reef fish to take into account both visual and olfactory threat cues simultaneously to optimise the amplitude of their kinematic responses to perceived risk.},

We analyzed high-speed cine films of goldfish C-starts elicited by dropping a ball into the water. It was previously thought that stage 1 angle does not vary concomitantly with the angle of the threatening stimulus relative to the position of the fish. We found, however, a significant inverse relationship between the direction of the impact of the ball and the angle turned by the end of stage 1. When starting near a wall, or when its usual trajectory was blocked by a wall, the fish used an escape route that was not predictable from the stimulus angle. The fish did not appear to correct its trajectory if it began to turn towards the ball. This behavioral evidence supports the previous notion that the underlying neural command is ballistic and does not use sensory information from the stimulus once the movement begins. If this is so, the fish probably utilizes information on obstacle location in the interval leading up to the trigger stimulus.},

Two fast-start kinematic patterns, L- and S-start were observed. In L-starts the body was bent into an L or U shape and a recoil turn normally accompanied acceleration. Free manoeuvre was not possible in L-starts without loss of speed. In S-starts the body was bent into an S-shape and fish accelerated without a recoil turn. The frequency of S-starts increased with size from 0 for the smallest fish to 60{\textendash}65\% for the largest fish. Acceleration turns were common. The radius of smallest turn for both fast-start patterns was proportional to length (L) with an overall radius of 0{\textendash}17 L. The duration of the primary acceleration stages increased with size from 0{\textendash}07 s for the group of smallest fish to 0{\textendash}10 s for the group of largest fish. Acceleration rates were independent of size. The overall mean maximum rate was 3438 cm/s2 and the average value to the end of the primary acceleration movements was 1562 cm/s2. The distance covered and velocity attained after a given time for fish accelerating from rest were independent of size. The results are discussed in the context of interactions between a predator and prey fish following initial approach by the predator. It is concluded that the outcome of an interaction is likely to depend on reaction times of interacting fish responding to manoeuvres initiated by the predator or prey. The prey reaction time results in the performance of the predator exceeding that of the prey at any instant. The predator reaction time and predator error in responses to unpredictable prey manoeuvre are required for prey escape. It is predicted that a predator should strike the prey within 0-1 s if the fish are initially 5{\textendash}15 cm apart as reported in the literature for predator-prey interactions. These distances would be increased for non-optimal prey escape behaviour and when the prey body was more compressed or depressed than the predator.},

Normal three-stage kinematic patterns were observed for all species. Fast-start movements were similar in all species, except Lepomis, which had slightly higher amplitudes than expected for its length. The duration of kinematic stages was a major variable among the seven species but was a linear function of length. Acceleration rates were not functions of size. Maximum acceleration rates ranged from 22-7 to 39-5 m. s-2 with mean rates from 6.1 to 12.3 m.s-2 averaged to the completion of kinematic stage 2. Maximum velocity and distance covered in each fast-start stage varied among species but were related to length. Fast-start performance depended primarily on compromise between muscle mass as a percentage of body mass, and lateral body and fin profile. Optimal profiles provide large depth distant from the centre of mass to maximize thrust, and anterior depth enhancement to minimize recoil. The body form of Lepomis is considered optimal for multiple swimming modes.},

The Mauthner (M-) cell triggers a complex startle or escape movement when the zebrafish,Brachydanio rerio, is presented with a sudden vibrational stimulus. Alternative (non-Mauthner) circuits functionally substitute for the M-cell to produce similar behavior patterns when the M-cell is missing or fails to fire. These responses are called non-Mauthner responses. In this paper, we demonstrate that vibrational stimulation of the tail reliably elicits responses initiated by non-Mauthner circuits in animals with intact M-cells. We conclude that such non-Mauthner circuits can functionally substitute for the M-cell in generating the escape response.                                                                            2.                                          To characterize sensory pathways responsible for activating the Mauthner and non-Mauthner responses in intact animals, we made detailed comparisons of response thresholds and latencies to vibrational stimuli applied to the head and the tail.                                                                            3.                                          In a comparison of vibrational stimulation applied to the head versus the tail, the M-cell was more sensitive to vibrational stimuli applied to the head. In pairwise comparisons the M-cell had the lowest threshold to the head stimulus in about 62{\%} of the trials and the shortest latency in 79{\%} of the trials (Table 1). For responses initiated by non-Mauthner cells, there was no difference in threshold to head and tail stimuli, but shorter latencies occurred when the head was stimulated than when the tail was stimulated (Table 1).                                                                            4.                                          In a comparison of Mauthner and non-Mauthner responses, we found that in 77{\%} of the trials, Mauthner responses occurred at lower stimulus intensities than the responses initiated by non-Mauthner circuits when a vibrational stimulus was applied to the head. But, when the tail was stimulated, there was no apparent difference in stimulus intensity required to elicit Mauthner responses and responses initiated by non-Mauthner circuits. The Mauthner responses were always substantially shorter in latency (by an average of 15 or 21 ms) than the responses initiated by non-Mauthner circuits when stimulating either the head or tail.                                                                            5.                                          We conclude that at least two sensory systems are involved in the activation of these startle systems when stimulating the head and tail of the zebrafish. One system is the otolithic receptors of the ear and another is probably either the posterior lateral line or Rohon-Beard cell system. The findings are discussed in terms of a general model that provides a mechanism for functional substitution of responses initiated by non-Mauthner circuits for Mauthner responses.                                                                    },

  abstract = {Abstract This paper reviews the development of our research on the motor consequences of Mauthner cell function and related brainstem neurons. These cells activate fast-start responses such as seen in fishes escaping from predatory attacks. Our goal was to devise a neuroethological theory of fish escape that accurately reconciled the underlying neural function with a correct concept of the motor act. The identified neuron concept of invertebrates greatly influenced the initial studies. Horseradish peroxidase technology allowed us and other workers to identify principal neurons in the brainstem escape system. Digital imaging technology permitted adequate kinematic characterization of the behavior. Resulting experiments showed that Mauthner system demonstrates two general principles of motor organization: (1) the Mauthner cell is a command-like higher order neuron that serially outputs to a lower level central pattern generator; and (2) the Mauthner cell participates in a larger parallel, brainstem escape network. In this network, we showed that the spatio-temporal pattern of activity codes the timing and magnitude of agonist and antagonist trunk muscle contractions during the behavior. Because the approach angle of the stimulus determines these parameters, we were able to discover the overall sensorimotor relationship between stimulus angle and motor output. This relationship is given as a set of descriptive equations written in terms of stimulus angle, magnitude and timing variables of trunk muscle contractions, and resulting escape trajectory. The equations unify the apparent variability of C-start movement patterns into a single, quantitative theory. Recent studies by other workers show how this concept can make accurate predictions about the underlying neural processes, even at the level of the single, identified cell.},

Many of the measures that have been developed to quantify multisensory integration (and which have been derived from single unit analyses), have been applied to these different measures without much consideration for the nature of the process being studied. Here, we provide a review focused on the means with which experimenters quantify multisensory processes and integration across a range of commonly used experimental methodologies.

In each section, we will discuss the different metrics commonly used to quantify multisensory interactions, including the rationale for their use, their advantages, and the drawbacks and caveats associated with them. Also discussed are possible alternatives to the most commonly used metrics.},

  abstract = {Abstract Approaching or looming signals are often related to extremely relevant environmental events (e.g. threats or collisions) making these signals critical for survival. However, the neural network underlying multisensory looming processing is not yet fully understood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we identified the neural correlates of audiovisual looming processing in humans: audiovisual looming (vs. receding) signals enhance fMRI-responses in low-level visual and auditory areas plus multisensory cortex (superior temporal sulcus; plus parietal and frontal structures). When characterizing the fMRI-response profiles for multisensory looming stimuli, we found significant enhancements relative to the mean and maximum of unisensory responses in looming-sensitive visual and auditory cortex plus STS. Superadditive enhancements were observed in visual cortex. Subject-specific region-of-interest analyses further revealed superadditive response profiles within all sensory-specific looming-sensitive structures plus bilateral STS for audiovisual looming vs. summed unisensory looming conditions. Finally, we observed enhanced connectivity of bilateral STS with low-level visual areas in the context of looming processing. This enhanced coupling of STS with unisensory regions might potentially serve to enhance the salience of unisensory stimulus features and is accompanied by superadditive fMRI-responses. We suggest that this preference in neural signaling for looming stimuli effectively informs animals to avoid potential threats or collisions.},

  abstract = {Summary The ability to integrate information across multiple sensory systems offers several behavioral advantages, from quicker reaction times and more accurate responses to better detection and more robust learning [1]. At the neural level, multisensory integration requires large-scale interactions between different brain regions—the convergence of information from separate sensory modalities, represented by distinct neuronal populations. The interactions between these neuronal populations must be fast and flexible, so that behaviorally relevant signals belonging to the same object or event can be immediately integrated and integration of unrelated signals can be prevented. Looming signals are a particular class of signals that are behaviorally relevant for animals and that occur in both the auditory and visual domain [2–4]. These signals indicate the rapid approach of objects and provide highly salient warning cues about impending impact. We show here that multisensory integration of auditory and visual looming signals may be mediated by functional interactions between auditory cortex and the superior temporal sulcus, two areas involved in integrating behaviorally relevant auditory-visual signals [5, 6]. Audiovisual looming signals elicited increased gamma-band coherence between these areas, relative to unimodal or receding-motion signals. This suggests that the neocortex uses fast, flexible intercortical interactions to mediate multisensory integration.},

These groups turn together in unison and produce escape waves. However, it is not clear how escape waves are created from local interactions, nor is it understood how these patterns are shaped by natural selection. By startling schools of fish with a simulated attack in an experimental arena, we demonstrate that changes in the direction and speed by a small percentage of individuals that detect the danger initiate an escape wave. This escape wave consists of a densely packed band of individuals that causes other school members to change direction. In the majority of cases, this wave passes through the entire group. We use a simulation model to demonstrate that this mechanism can, through local interactions alone, produce arbitrarily large escape waves. In the model, when we set the group density to that seen in real fish schools, we find that the risk to the members at the edge of the group is roughly equal to the risk of those within the group. Our experiments and modelling results provide a plausible explanation for how escape waves propagate in nature without centralized control.},

In a wide range of fishes, hindbrain segments contain orderly arranged reticulospinal neurons (RSNs). Individual RSNs in goldfish and zebrafish hindbrain are morphologically identified. RSNs sharing similar morphological features are called segmental homologs and repeated in adjacent segments. However, little is known about functional relationships among segmental homologs. Here we investigated the electrophysiological connectivity between the Mauthner cell (M-cell), a pair of giant RSNs in segment 4 (r4) that are known to trigger fast escape behavior, and different series of homologous RSNs in r4{\textendash}r6. Paired intracellular recordings in adult goldfish revealed unidirectional connections from the M-cell to RSNs. The connectivity was similar in morphological homologs. A single M-cell spike produced IPSPs in dorsally located RSNs (MiD cells) on the ipsilateral side and excitatory postsynaptic depolarization on the contralateral side, except for MiD2cm cells. The inhibitory or excitatory potentials effectively suppressed or enhanced target RSNs spiking, respectively. In contrast to the lateralized effects on MiD cells, single M-cell spiking elicited equally strong depolarizations on bilateral RSNs located ventrally (MiV cells), and the depolarization was high enough for MiV cells to burst. Therefore, the morphological homology of repeated RSNs in r4{\textendash}r6 and their functional M-cell connectivity were closely correlated, suggesting that each functional connection works as a functional motif during the M-cell-initiated escape.},

The best quantitative approach to analyzing connectome data is still unclear but graph theory has been used with success. We present a graph theoretical model of the posterior lateral line sensorimotor pathway in zebrafish. The model includes 2,616 neurons and 167,114 synaptic connections. Model neurons represent known cell types in zebrafish larvae, and connections were set stochastically following rules based on biological literature. Thus, our model is a uniquely detailed computational representation of a vertebrate connectome. The connectome has low overall connection density, with 2.45% of all possible connections, a value within the physiological range. We used graph theoretical tools to compare the zebrafish connectome graph to small-world, random and structured random graphs of the same size. For each type of graph, 100 randomly generated instantiations were considered. Degree distribution (the number of connections per neuron) varied more in the zebrafish graph than in same size graphs with less biological detail. There was high local clustering and a short average path length between nodes, implying a small-world structure similar to other neural connectomes and complex networks. The graph was found not to be scale-free, in agreement with some other neural connectomes. An experimental lesion was performed that targeted three model brain neurons, including the Mauthner neuron, known to control fast escape turns. The lesion decreased the number of short paths between sensory and motor neurons analogous to the behavioral effects of the same lesion in zebrafish. This model is expandable and can be used to organize and interpret a growing database of information on the zebrafish connectome.},

Using a defined zebrafish escape circuit as a model, we found that behavior selection can be implemented at the visuomotor transformation stage through a visually responsive dopaminergic-inhibitory circuit module. In response to non-threatening visual stimuli, hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons and their positively regulated hindbrain inhibitory interneurons increase activity, suppressing synaptic transmission from the visual center to the escape circuit. By contrast, threatening visual stimuli inactivate some of these neurons, resulting in dis-inhibition of the visuomotor transformation and escape generation. The distinct patterns of dopaminergic-inhibitory neural module’s visual responses account for this stimulus-specific visuomotor transformation and behavioral control. Thus, our study identifies a behavioral relevance-dependent mechanism that controls visuomotor transformation and behavior selection and reveals that neuromodulation can be tuned by visual cues to help animals generate appropriate responses.},

  abstract = {The hindbrain of larval zebrafish contains a relatively simple ground plan in which the neurons throughout it are arranged into stripes that represent broad neuronal classes that differ in transmitter identity, morphology, and transcription factor expression. Within the stripes, neurons are stacked continuously according to age as well as structural and functional properties, such as axonal extent, input resistance, and the speed at which they are recruited during movements. Here we address the question of how particular networks among the many different sensory-motor networks in hindbrain arise from such an orderly plan. We use a combination of transgenic lines and pairwise patch recording to identify excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the hindbrain network for escape behaviors initiated by the Mauthner cell. We map this network onto the ground plan to show that an individual hindbrain network is built by drawing components in predictable ways from the underlying broad patterning of cell types stacked within stripes according to their age and structural and functional properties. Many different specialized hindbrain networks may arise similarly from a simple early patterning.},

   broad interspecific similarities in Mauthner cell morphology, the motor
   patterns and startle behaviors it initiates vary markedly. Response
   diversity has been hypothesized to result, in part, from differences in
   the structure and function of the Mauthner cell-associated axon cap. We
   used light microscopy techniques to compare axon cap morphology across a
   wide range of species, including all four extant basal actinopterygian
   orders, representatives of a variety of teleost lineages and lungfishes,
   and we combined our data with published descriptions of axon cap
   structure. The `composite' axon cap, observed in teleosts, is an
   organized conglomeration of glia and fibers of inhibitory and excitatory
   interneurons. Lungfish, amphibian tadpoles and several basal
   actinopterygian fishes have `simple' axon caps that appear to lack glia
   and include few fibers. Several other basal actinopterygian fishes have
   `simple-dense' caps that include greater numbers of fibers than simple
   caps, but lack the additional elements and organization of composite
   caps. Phylogenetic mapping shows that through evolution there are
   discrete transitions in axon cap morphology occurring at the base of
   gnathostomes, within basal actinopterygians, and at the base of the
   teleost radiation. Comparing axon cap evolution to the evolution of
   startle behavior and motor pattern provides insight into the

Behavioral responses to predator-like looming stimuli, and their underlying neural computations, are remarkably similar across species. Recently, genetic tools have been applied in this classical paradigm, revealing novel non-cortical pathways that connect loom processing to defensive behaviors in mammals and demonstrating that loom encoding models from locusts also fit vertebrate neural responses. In both invertebrates and vertebrates, relative spike-timing in descending pathways is a mechanism for escape behavior choice. Current findings suggest that experimentally tractable systems, such as Drosophila, may be applicable models for sensorimotor processing and persistent states in higher organisms.},

  abstract = { Similar to most visual animals, crabs perform proper avoidance responses to objects directly approaching them. The monostratified lobula giant neurons of type 1 (MLG1) of crabs constitute an ensemble of 14–16 bilateral pairs of motion-detecting neurons projecting from the lobula (third optic neuropile) to the midbrain, with receptive fields that are distributed over the extensive visual field of the animal's eye. Considering the crab Neohelice (previously Chasmagnathus) granulata, here we describe the response of these neurons to looming stimuli that simulate objects approaching the animal on a collision course. We found that the peak firing time of MLG1 acts as an angular threshold detector signaling, with a delay of δ = 35 ms, the time at which an object reaches a fixed angular threshold of 49°. Using in vivo intracellular recordings, we detected the existence of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents that shape the neural response. Other functional features identified in the MLG1 neurons were phasic responses at the beginning of the approach, a relation between the stimulus angular velocity and the excitation delay, and a mapping between membrane potential and firing frequency. Using this information, we propose a biophysical model of the mechanisms that regulate the encoding of looming stimuli. Furthermore, we found that the parameter encoded by the MLG1 firing frequency during the approach is the stimulus angular velocity. The proposed model fits the experimental results and predicts the neural response to a qualitatively different stimulus. Based on these and previous results, we propose that the MLG1 neuron system acts as a directional coding system for collision avoidance. },

  abstract  = {Abstract Although visually evoked Mauthner cell (M-cell) startle responses occur in the goldfish, the afferent projections underlying these reactions have not been previously studied. We have recorded from the M-cell while stimulating the left optic nerve and/or right optic tectum and have traced projections of the optic nerve and restricted areas of the optic tectum using HRP histochemistry and autoradiography. Tectal stimulation elicits similar postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in both M-cells. The responses recorded in the right (ipsilateral) cell were localized to its ventral dendrite. The existence of uncrossed tectal projections to the ventral dendrite was confirmed morphologically following application of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to the optic tectum. The PSPs contained both inhibitory and excitatory components, but with adequate stimulus strength, excitation of either M-cell dominated. Thus, this pathway is probably sufficient to trigger visually evoked startle responses mediated by the M-cell. Stimulation of the left optic nerve also evoked PSPs capable of bringing both M-cells to threshold. The blockage of this response by conditioning stimulation of the right tectum suggests that the visual information is relayed to the M-cells through this structure. In support of these findings, no label was found near any portion of the M-cell after either intraocular injection of tritiated proline or application of HRP to the cut end of the optic nerve. In summary, visual input to the M-cell is mediated via projections from the tectum, is segregated onto the ventral dendrite, and is capable of bringing this neuron to threshold. This pathway presumably accounts for the demonstrated behavioral efficacy of visual stimuli in evoking a startle response.},

The Mauthner cell (M-cell) in the fourth segment (r4) is known to trigger fast escape behavior. Its serial homologs, MiD2cm in r5 and MiD3cm in r6, are predicted to contribute to this behavior, which can be evoked by head-tap stimuli. However, little is known about their input{\textendash}output properties. Therefore, we studied afferent projections from the auditory posterior eighth nerve (pVIIIn) and firing properties of MiD2cm and MiD3cm for comparison with the M-cell in adult goldfish. Labeling of RS neurons and the pVIIIn afferents with fluorescent tracers showed that the pVIIIn projected to r4{\textendash}r6. Tone burst and electrical stimulation of the pVIIIn evoked EPSPs in the M-cell, MiD2cm, and MiD3cm. Stepwise depolarization typically elicited a single spike at the onset in the M-cell but repetitive spiking in MiD2cm and MiD3cm. This atypical property of the M-cell was mediated by dendrotoxin-I (DTX-I)-sensitive voltage-gated potassium channels together with recurrent inhibition, because combined application of DTX-I, strychnine, and bicuculline led to continuous repetitive firing in M-cells. The M-cell but not MiD2cm or MiD3cm expressed Kv1.2, a DTX-I-sensitive potassium channel subunit. Thus, the M-cell and its segmental homologs may sense common auditory information but send different outputs to the spinal circuits to control adaptive escape behavior.},

Its simple neural circuit has made this behavior a model for examining neural control of movement. The S-start, initiated with an S-shaped body bend, is a physiologically distinct escape that occurs in esocid fishes. Here we examine whether zebrafish larvae perform S-starts in order to better understand startle diversity and to attempt to identify the S-start in a system that is tractable for neurobiological studies. We found that larval zebrafish startles varied in the extent of their caudal bending, resulting in C, S and intermediate-shaped responses. We recorded two distinct motor patterns: nearly simultaneous initial activity along one side of the body, characteristic of C-starts, and nearly simultaneous activity rostrally on one side and caudally on the other, characteristic of S-starts. Head stimulation generally elicited C-starts while tail stimulation elicited C- and S-starts. These results demonstrate that the S-start is more common than previously documented and occurs in early developmental stages. We suggest that the S-start may be a fundamental escape behavior in fishes and may provide a comparative model to the C-start for understanding simple neural circuits.},

In aquatic vertebrates such as fishes and tadpoles, these include escape behaviors, swimming across a range of speeds, and struggling. We addressed the question of whether these behaviors are accomplished by a shared set of spinal interneurons activated in different patterns or, instead, involve specialized spinal interneurons that may shape the motor output to produce particular behaviors. We used larval zebrafish because they are capable of several distinct axial motor behaviors using a common periphery and a relatively small set of spinal neurons, easing the task of exploring the extent to which cell types are specialized for particular motor patterns. We performed targeted in vivo whole-cell patch recordings in 3 d post fertilization larvae to reveal the activity pattern of four commissural glycinergic interneuron types during escape, swimming and struggling behaviors. While some neuronal classes were shared among different motor patterns, we found others that were active only during a single one. These specialized neurons had morphological and functional properties consistent with a role in shaping key features of the motor behavior in which they were active. Our results, in combination with other evidence from excitatory interneurons, support the idea that patterns of activity in a core network of shared spinal neurons may be shaped by more specialized interneurons to produce an assortment of motor behaviors.},

In fishes, these axis-based startle behaviors fall into three distinct categories – the C-start, withdrawal, and S-start – defined by patterns of body bending and underlying motor control. Startle behaviors have been widely studied due to their importance for predator evasion. In addition, the neural circuits that control startles are relatively accessible, compared to other vertebrate circuits, and have provided opportunities to understand basic nervous system function. The C-start neural circuit has long been a model in systems neuroscience and considerable work on neural control of withdrawal response has been conducted in the larval lamprey. The S-start response has only recently been explored from a physiological perspective and we focus here on reviewing S-start motor control and movement in the context of the other two responses. Axial elongation has previously been associated with startle behavior in comparisons of C-starts and withdrawal, with extremely elongate animals performing withdrawals. We suggest that the S-start tends to occur with moderate body elongation, complementing the C-start in animals with this body form. As many larval fishes are moderately elongate, we suggest that the S-start may be common in larvae but may be secondarily lost with body shape change through development.},

In risky situations, the safety conferred by the presence of conspecifics can outweigh the costs of competition for resources. How the costs and benefits of grouping influence decisions among alternative antipredator behaviors remains largely unexplored. We took advantage of the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to examine the influence of social context on alternative behavioral responses to threats. We compared the frequency of active (startle) versus passive (freeze) responses to sudden acoustic stimuli in the presence and absence of conspecifics. We found that fish were relatively less likely to startle and more likely to freeze when in a group than when alone, indicating that immediate social context modulates predator evasion strategy in guppies. We suggest that these social context-dependent changes reflect trade-offs between survival and energy expenditure. To our knowledge, an effect of immediate social environment on startle probability has not been previously demonstrated in a teleost.},

  abstract  = {Summary Social transmission of information is vital for many group-living animals, allowing coordination of motion and effective response to complex environments. Revealing the interaction networks underlying information flow within these groups is a central challenge [1]. Previous work has modeled interactions between individuals based directly on their relative spatial positions: each individual is considered to interact with all neighbors within a fixed distance (metric range [2]), a fixed number of nearest neighbors (topological range [3]), a ‘shell’ of near neighbors (Voronoi range [4]), or some combination (Figure 1A). However, conclusive evidence to support these assumptions is lacking. Here, we employ a novel approach that considers individual movement decisions to be based explicitly on the sensory information available to the organism. In other words, we consider that while spatial relations do inform interactions between individuals, they do so indirectly, through individuals’ detection of sensory cues. We reconstruct computationally the visual field of each individual throughout experiments designed to investigate information propagation within fish schools (golden shiners, Notemigonus crysoleucas). Explicitly considering visual sensing allows us to more accurately predict the propagation of behavioral change in these groups during leadership events. Furthermore, we find that structural properties of visual interaction networks differ markedly from those of metric and topological counterparts, suggesting that previous assumptions may not appropriately reflect information flow in animal groups.},

Precisely how predation has shaped individuals{\textquoteright} fine-scale social interactions in natural populations, however, is unknown. Using high-resolution tracking data of shoaling fish (Poecilia reticulata) from populations differing in natural predation pressure, we show how predation adapts individuals{\textquoteright} social interaction rules. Fish originating from high predation environments formed larger, more cohesive, but not more polarized groups than fish from low predation environments. Using a new approach to detect the discrete points in time when individuals decide to update their movements based on the available social cues, we determine how these collective properties emerge from individuals{\textquoteright} microscopic social interactions. We first confirm predictions that predation shapes the attraction{\textendash}repulsion dynamic of these fish, reducing the critical distance at which neighbours move apart, or come back together. While we find strong evidence that fish align with their near neighbours, we do not find that predation shapes the strength or likelihood of these alignment tendencies. We also find that predation sharpens individuals{\textquoteright} acceleration and deceleration responses, implying key perceptual and energetic differences associated with how individuals move in different predation regimes. Our results reveal how predation can shape the social interactions of individuals in groups, ultimately driving differences in groups{\textquoteright} collective behaviour.},

  abstract  = {Week-old zebrafish execute many complex, visually guided actions using a brain that displays the canonical vertebrate organization, but is less than a cubic millimeter in size. Recent studies have made considerable progress towards understanding the underlying neural circuit basis of these innate responses, at two fundamental levels. Large-scale population recordings have revealed how functional properties and activity dynamics are organized within and across brain regions. Meanwhile, single neurons have been specifically labeled to systematically characterize cell types with distinct morphologies and projection patterns. Combining these approaches, in order to investigate the role of individual, identified neurons in generating neural activity dynamics and behavior, has traditionally been possible only for simple invertebrate systems, but is now becoming feasible in a vertebrate model.},

Key points


* The present study examines dendritic integrative processes that occur in many central neurons but have been challenging to study in vivo in the vertebrate brain. The Mauthner cell of goldfish receives auditory and visual information via two separate dendrites, providing a privileged scenario for in vivo examination of dendritic integration.

* The results show differential attenuation properties in the Mauthner cell dendrites arising at least partly from differences in cable properties and the nonlinear behaviour of the respective dendritic membranes.

* In addition to distinct modality-dependent membrane specialization in neighbouring dendrites of the Mauthner cell, we report cross-modal dendritic interactions via backpropagating postsynaptic potentials.

* Broadly, the results of the present study provide an exceptional example for the processing power of single neurons.


Abstract
Animals process multimodal information for adaptive behavioural decisions. In fish, evasion of a diving bird that breaks the water surface depends on integrating visual and auditory stimuli with very different characteristics. How do neurons process such differential sensory inputs at the dendritic level? For that, we studied the Mauthner cells (M-cells) in the goldfish startle circuit, which receive visual and auditory inputs via two separate dendrites, both accessible for in vivo recordings. We investigated whether electrophysiological membrane properties and dendrite morphology, studied in vivo, play a role in selective sensory processing in the M-cell. The results obtained show that anatomical and electrophysiological differences between the dendrites combine to produce stronger attenuation of visually evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) than to auditory evoked PSPs. Interestingly, our recordings showed also cross-modal dendritic interaction because auditory evoked PSPs invade the ventral dendrite (VD), as well as the opposite where visual PSPs invade the lateral dendrite (LD). However, these interactions were asymmetrical, with auditory PSPs being more prominent in the VD than visual PSPs in the LD. Modelling experiments imply that this asymmetry is caused by active conductances expressed in the proximal segments of the VD. The results obtained in the present study suggest modality-dependent membrane specialization in M-cell dendrites suited for processing stimuli of different time domains and, more broadly, provide a compelling example of information processing in single neurons.

  abstract  = { Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is typically associated with an attenuation of auditory startle behavior in mammals and is presumably mediated within the brainstem startle circuit. However, the inhibitory mechanisms underlying PPI are not yet clear. We addressed this question with complementary behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological experiments in the startle escape circuit of goldfish, the Mauthner cell (M-cell) system. In the behavioral experiments we observed a 77.5\% attenuation (PPI) of startle escape probability following auditory prepulse–pulse stimulation. The PPI effect was observed for prepulse–pulse interstimulus intervals (ISIs) ranging from 20 to 600 ms and its magnitude depended linearly on prepulse intensity over a range of 14 dB. Electrophysiological recordings of synaptic responses to a sound pulse in the M-cell, which is the sensorimotor neuron initiating startle escapes, showed a 21\% reduction in amplitude of the dendritic postsynaptic potential (PSP) and a 23\% reduction of the somatic PSP following a prepulse. In addition, a prepulse evoked a long-lasting (500 ms) decrease in M-cell excitability indicated by 1) an increased threshold current, 2) an inhibitory shunt of the action potential (AP), and 3) by a linearized M-cell membrane, which effectively impedes M-cell AP generation. Comparing the magnitude and kinetics of inhibitory shunts evoked by a prepulse in the M-cell dendrite and soma revealed a disproportionately larger and longer-lasting inhibition in the dendrite. These results suggest that the observed PPI-type attenuation of startle behavior can be correlated to distinct postsynaptic mechanisms mediated primarily at the M-cell lateral dendrite. },

In these systems, taken as individual units or as networks of globally or locally coupled elements, we study various phenomena due to noise, such as noise-induced oscillations, stochastic resonance, stochastic synchronization, noise-induced phase transitions and noise-induced pulse and spiral dynamics. Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations and their corresponding Fokker–Planck equations, treated by both analytical calculations and/or numerical simulations. We calculate and/or measure the rate and diffusion coefficient of the excitation process, as well as spectral quantities like power spectra and degree of coherence. Combined with a multiparametric bifurcation analysis of the corresponding cumulant equations, these approaches provide a comprehensive picture of the multifaceted dynamical behaviour of noisy excitable systems.},

  abstract  = {While the effects of social experience on nervous system function have been extensively investigated in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, our understanding of how social status differentially affects learning remains limited. In the context of habituation, a well-characterized form of non-associative learning, we investigated how the learning processes differ between socially dominant and subordinate in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We found that social status and frequency of stimulus inputs influence the habituation rate of short latency C-start escape response that is initiated by the Mauthner neuron (M-cell). Socially dominant animals exhibited higher habituation rates compared to socially subordinate animals at a moderate stimulus frequency, but low stimulus frequency eliminated this difference of habituation rates between the two social phenotypes. Moreover, habituation rates of both dominants and subordinates were higher at a moderate stimulus frequency compared to those at a low stimulus frequency. We investigated a potential mechanism underlying these status-dependent differences by constructing a simplified neurocomputational model of the M-cell escape circuit. The computational study showed that the change in total net excitability of the model M-cell was able to replicate the experimental results. At moderate stimulus frequency, the model M-cell with lower total net excitability, that mimicked a dominant-like phenotype, exhibited higher habituation rates. On the other hand, the model with higher total net excitability, that mimicked the subordinate-like phenotype, exhibited lower habituation rates. The relationship between habituation rates and characteristics (frequency and amplitude) of the repeated stimulus were also investigated. We found that habituation rates are decreasing functions of amplitude and increasing functions of frequency while these rates depend on social status (higher for dominants and lower for subordinate). Our results show that social status affects habituative learning in zebrafish, which could be mediated by a summative neuromodulatory input to the M-cell escape circuit, which enables animals to readily learn to adapt to changes in their social environment.},

We explored how sensitive collective behaviour models are to these sensory assumptions. Specifically, we used parameters reflecting the visual coverage and visual acuity that determine the spatial range over which an individual can detect and interact with conspecifics. Using metric and topological collective behaviour models, we compared the classic sensory parameters, typically used to model birds and fish, with a set of realistic sensory parameters obtained through physiological measurements. Compared with the classic sensory assumptions, the realistic assumptions increased perceptual ranges, which led to fewer groups and larger group sizes in all species, and higher polarity values and slightly shorter neighbour distances in the fish species. Overall, classic visual sensory assumptions are not representative of many species showing collective behaviour and constrain unrealistically their perceptual ranges. More importantly, caution must be exercised when empirically testing the predictions of these models in terms of choosing the model species, making realistic predictions, and interpreting the results.},

Zebrafish are small and prolific, which lends this species to high throughput screening applications. A typical feature of zebrafish is its propensity to aggregate in groups, a behavior known as shoaling. Thus, zebrafish has been proposed as a possible model organism appropriate for the analysis of the genetics of vertebrate social behavior. However, shoaling behavior is not well characterized in zebrafish. Here, using a recently developed software application, we first investigate how zebrafish respond to conspecific and heterospecific fish species that differ in coloration and/or shoaling tendencies. We found that zebrafish shoaled with their own species but not with two heterospecific species, one of which was a shoaling the other a non-shoaling species. In addition, we have started the analysis of visual stimuli that zebrafish may utilize to determine whether to shoal with a fish or not. We systematically modified the color, the location, the pattern, and the body shape of computer animated zebrafish images and presented them to experimental zebrafish. The subjects responded differentially to some of these stimuli showing preference for yellow and avoidance of elongated zebrafish images. Our results suggest that computerized stimulus presentation and automated behavioral quantification of zebrafish responses are feasible, which in turn implies that high throughput forward genetic mutation or drug screening will be possible in the analysis of social behavior with this model organism.},

        Many species of fish rely on their visual systems to interact with conspecifics and these interactions can lead to collective behavior. Individual-based models have been used to predict collective interactions; however, these models generally make simplistic assumptions about the sensory systems that are applied without proper empirical testing to different species. This could limit our ability to predict (and test empirically) collective behavior in species with very different sensory requirements. In this study, we characterized components of the visual system in two species of cyprinid fish known to engage in visually dependent collective interactions (zebrafish \textit{Danio rerio} and golden shiner \textit{Notemigonus crysoleucas}) and derived quantitative predictions about the positioning of individuals within schools. We found that both species had relatively narrow binocular and blind fields and wide visual coverage. However, golden shiners had more visual coverage in the vertical plane (binocular field extending behind the head) and higher visual acuity than zebrafish. The centers of acute vision (\textit{areae}) of both species projected in the fronto-dorsal region of the visual field, but those of the zebrafish projected more dorsally than those of the golden shiner. Based on this visual sensory information, we predicted that: (a) predator detection time could be increased by >1,000% in zebrafish and >100% in golden shiners with an increase in nearest neighbor distance, (b) zebrafish schools would have a higher roughness value (surface area/volume ratio) than those of golden shiners, (c) and that nearest neighbor distance would vary from 8 to 20 cm to visually resolve conspecific striping patterns in both species. Overall, considering between-species differences in the sensory system of species exhibiting collective behavior could change the predictions about the positioning of individuals in the group as well as the shape of the school, which can have implications for group cohesion. We suggest that more effort should be invested in assessing the role of the sensory system in shaping local interactions driving collective behavior.

Recent advances in the understanding of sensory system and information processing by animals impels one to revise classical assumptions made in decisional algorithms. In this context, we present a model describing the three-dimensional visual sensory system of fish that adjust their trajectory according to their perception field. Furthermore, we introduce a stochastic process based on a probability distribution function to move in targeted directions rather than on a summation of influential vectors as is classically assumed by most models. In parallel, we present experimental results of zebrafish (alone or in group of 10) swimming in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We use these experimental data to set the parameter values of our model and show that this perception-based approach can simulate the collective motion of species showing cohesive behaviour in heterogeneous environments. Finally, we discuss the advances of this multilayer model and its possible outcomes in biological, physical and robotic sciences.},

  abstract  = {Larger groups often have a greater ability to solve cognitive tasks compared to smaller ones or lone individuals. This is well established in social insects, navigating flocks of birds, and in groups of prey collectively vigilant for predators. Research in social insects has convincingly shown that improved cognitive performance can arise from self-organised local interactions between individuals that integrates their contributions, often referred to as swarm intelligence. This emergent collective intelligence has gained in popularity and been directly applied to groups of other animals, including fish. Despite being a likely mechanism at least partially explaining group performance in vertebrates, I argue here that other possible explanations are rarely ruled out in empirical studies. Hence, evidence for self-organised collective (or ‘swarm’) intelligence in fish is not as strong as it would first appear. These other explanations, the ‘pool-of-competence’ and the greater cognitive ability of individuals when in larger groups, are also reviewed. Also discussed is why improved group performance in general may be less often observed in animals such as shoaling fish compared to social insects. This review intends to highlight the difficulties in exploring collective intelligence in animal groups, ideally leading to further empirical work to illuminate these issues.},

  abstract  = {Animal groups on the move can take different configurations. For example, groups of fish can either be ‘shoals’ or ‘schools’: shoals are simply aggregations of individuals; schools are shoals exhibiting polarized, synchronized motion. Here we demonstrate that polarization distributions of groups of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are bimodal, showing two distinct modes of collective motion corresponding to the definitions of shoaling and schooling. Other features of the group's motion also vary consistently between the two modes: zebrafish schools are faster and less dense than zebrafish shoals. Habituation to an environment can also alter the proportion of time zebrafish groups spend schooling or shoaling. Models of collective motion suggest that the degree and stability of group polarization increases with the group's density. Examining zebrafish groups of different sizes from 5 to 50, we show that larger groups are less polarized than smaller groups. Decreased fearfulness in larger groups may function similarly to habituation, causing them to spend more time shoaling than schooling, contrary to most models' predictions.},

  abstract  = {Quantitative analyses of the effects of temporary blindfolding (BL) or lateralis section (LS) on the schooling performance of saithe (Pollachius virens) are reported. Comparison of effects of the sensory deprivations on school structure and dynamics allow determination of the relative roles of the lateral lines and vision in normal schooling. Extended 3-dimensional records were made of the positions of sensorily deprived individuals in normal schools as well as whole schools with sensory treatments.                                      1.                                          Blinding had little effect on the position experimental fish took up with respect to their neighbors within the school (Fig. 2). In contrast, lateralis section resulted in a great increase in the frequency of neighbors at 90{\textdegree} bearing (directly alongside) (Fig. 2).                                                                            2.                                          Both BL and LS fish exhibited different characteristic nearest neighbor distances (NNDs) than controls, with blinding increasing NND and lateralis section decreasing NND (Fig. 4).                                                                            3.                                          Importance of the lateral line in transmission of a fright response and sudden velocity changes within a school is demonstrated by experiments in which schools were intentionally startled. In schools of LS fish there exist significant relationships between latency to startle and the distance and angle between a fish and the startling object. Such relationships are not seen in normal schools: with intact lateral lines, fish respond with similar latencies to objects in all directions (Fig. 5).                                                                            4.                                          Fish which are blindfolded are able nonetheless to match short-term changes in velocity of their neighbors and actually show higher correlations than do controls (Fig. 8 b). Lateralis section does not reduce correlations between fish and neighbors (Fig. 8 d) probably because LS fish take up positions at which they can best determine neighbors' velocities by vision alone.                                                      },

Multiunit activity was recorded in the torus longitudinalis (TL) of unanesthetized, immobilized goldfish while spontaneous eye movements were monitored with a search coil. Each saccade was accompanied by a burst of activity that started at the beginning of the saccade and peaked 120--150 ms later. Normally, the integrated burst amplitude was proportional to the saccade amplitude, but was independent of saccade direction or eye position. Saccadic bursts cannot be visual or proprioceptive in origin because they occur in the dark; are not evoked by passive eye movements; and persist after total paralysis with Flaxedil. Ablation of TL did not affect spontaneous eye movements.                                                                            2.                                          Photic responses, also recorded in TL, were predominantly sustained multiunit discharges to dimming of the visual field of the contralateral eye. Diffuse receptive fields were located somewhat below the field equator, and mapped naso-temporally upon the rostro-caudal axis of TL. The photic responses of TL were more sustained and of longer latency than activity recorded simultaneously in the tectum.                                                                            3.                                          Photic responses occurred more superficially in TL than the saccadic responses. Lesions of tectum abolished the photic response in the ipsilateral TL, but only attenuated the saccadic response. Lesioning the valvula, but not other parts of the cerebellum abolished the saccadic response of TL without affecting the photic response. After small lesions in the TL itself, saccadic responses were diminished, and sometimes depended upon the direction of eye movement, and the eye-in-orbit position.                                                                            4.                                          It was concluded that the photic responses in one TL derive from a topographic input from the ipsilateral tectum. These responses are probably generated by a population of neurons different from those responsible for the saccadic responses. The latter originate in the valvula of the cerebellum, which apparently transmits information about saccade direction and eye position.                                                                    },

Recent detailed circuit analyses in simpler neural systems have started to reveal the connectivity patterns underlying analogous processes. Here we review a few of these systems that share a particular connectivity pattern, namely mutual inhibition of lateral inhibition. Close examination of these systems suggests that this recurring connectivity pattern (‘network motif’) is a building block to enforce particular dynamics, which can be used not only for simple behavioral choice but also for more complex choices and other brain functions. Thus, a network motif provides an elementary computation that is not specific to a particular brain function and serves as an elementary building block in the brain. },

This includes the extraction of salient features from visual scenes, such as motion directionality or contrast, through neurons belonging to distinct neural circuits. Some retinal neurons are tuned to the orientation of elongated visual stimuli. Such ‘orientation-selective’ neurons are present in the retinae of most, if not all, vertebrate species analysed to date, with species-specific differences in frequency and degree of tuning. In some cases, orientation-selective neurons have very stereotyped functional and morphological properties suggesting that they represent distinct cell types. In this review, we describe the retinal cell types underlying orientation selectivity found in various vertebrate species, and highlight their commonalities and differences. In addition, we discuss recent studies that revealed the cellular, synaptic and circuit mechanisms at the basis of retinal orientation selectivity. Finally, we outline the significance of these findings in shaping our current understanding of how this fundamental neural computation is implemented in the visual systems of vertebrates.},

Axons of RGCs then travel through the optic nerve, telling the rest of the brain all it will ever know about the visual world. Research over the past several decades has made clear that most RGCs are not merely light detectors, but rather feature detectors, which send a diverse set of parallel, highly processed images of the world on to higher centers. Here, we review progress in classification of RGCs by physiological, morphological, and molecular criteria, making a particular effort to distinguish those cell types that are definitive from those for which information is partial. We focus on the mouse, in which molecular and genetic methods are most advanced. We argue that there are around 30 RGC types and that we can now account for well over half of all RGCs. We also use RGCs to examine the general problem of neuronal classification, arguing that insights and methods from the retina can guide the classification enterprise in other brain regions. },

Recently, a number of studies started to investigate methods with which fear responses may be induced reliably in zebrafish. The ultimate goal of these studies has been to develop zebrafish models of pathological processes and to investigate the mechanisms of fear and to eventually translate the findings to the human clinic. Previously, animated image of a sympatric predator of zebrafish was shown to induce fear responses. Here we expand on this recently gained knowledge and investigate whether other moving images may induce more robust fear responses. The images investigated include the original sympatric predator, the Indian leaf fish, another sympatric predator, the needle fish, a bird silhouette moved on the side or above the tank, an expanding dot mimicking rapid approach of an object shown on the side and from above the tank, as well as non-fear inducing images including a single and a group of zebrafish. Our results indicate that although the sympatric predators do induce some fear responses, the other images, particularly the expanding dot but also the bird silhouette shown from above are more effective. The results also reveal a stimulus dependent motor pattern response repertoire of zebrafish demonstrating that perhaps univariate quantification methods may not be appropriate for uncovering the complexity of fear or anxiety related phenotypical changes in this species.},

Endocannabinoids are well established as inhibitors of chemical synaptic transmission via presynaptic activation of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor ({CB}1R). Contrasting this notion, we show that dendritic release of endocannabinoids mediates potentiation of synaptic transmission at mixed (electrical and chemical) synaptic contacts on the goldfish Mauthner cell. Remarkably, the observed enhancement was not restricted to the glutamatergic component of the synaptic response but also included a parallel increase in electrical transmission. This effect involved the activation of {CB}1 receptors and was indirectly mediated via the release of dopamine from nearby varicosities, which in turn led to potentiation of the synaptic response via a {cAMP}-dependent protein kinase-mediated postsynaptic mechanism. Thus, endocannabinoid release can potentiate synaptic transmission, and its functional roles include the regulation of gap junction-mediated electrical synapses. Similar interactions between endocannabinoid and dopaminergic systems may be widespread and potentially relevant for the motor and rewarding effects of cannabis derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Brain function relies on the ability of neurons to communicate with each other. Interneuronal communication primarily takes place at synapses, where information from one neuron is rapidly conveyed to a second neuron. There are two main modalities of synaptic transmission: chemical and electrical. Far from functioning independently and serving unrelated functions, mounting evidence indicates that these two modalities of synaptic transmission closely interact, both during development and in the adult brain. Rather than conceiving synaptic transmission as either chemical or electrical, this article emphasizes the notion that synaptic transmission is both chemical and electrical, and that interactions between these two forms of interneuronal communication might be required for normal brain development and function.},

  abstract      = {Summary
Visual cues often modulate auditory signal processing, leading to improved sound detection. However, the synaptic and circuit mechanism underlying this cross-modal modulation remains poorly understood. Using larval zebrafish, we first established a cross-modal behavioral paradigm in which a preceding flash enhances sound-evoked escape behavior, which is known to be executed through auditory afferents ({VIIIth} nerves) and command-like neurons (Mauthner cells). In vivo recording revealed that the visual enhancement of auditory escape is achieved by increasing sound-evoked Mauthner cell responses. This increase in Mauthner cell responses is accounted for by the increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of sound-evoked {VIIIth} nerve spiking and efficacy of {VIIIth} nerve-Mauthner cell synapses. Furthermore, the visual enhancement of Mauthner cell response and escape behavior requires light-responsive dopaminergic neurons in the caudal hypothalamus and D1 dopamine receptor activation. Our findings illustrate a cooperative neural mechanism for visual modulation of audiomotor processing that involves dopaminergic neuromodulation.},
