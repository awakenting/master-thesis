## A neuronal model for visually evoked escape responses in schooling fish
This repository contains everything related to my master thesis.

# Research questions
1. How does the mauthner circuit produce experimentally observed escape responses when presented with a looming stimulus ?
    2. How should the input that arrives at the Mauthner cell look like to create experimentally observed escape responses ?
    3. How is this input related to the visual scene that the fish observes ?
4. What happens if we present two simultaneous looming stimuli to a model that can reproduce results for one stimulus ?
5. What happens if we use a model that can reproduce results for one stimulus for fish that move in school ?
    6. Would this induce spontaneous startles in fish ? How many startles would we see in a certain time window ?

# Reproducibility

### Requirements:
- python 3.6
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn

If you use [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), you can just use the enviroment file to create an environment with all necessary packages. To do so ...

# Materials

## Literature
I collect relevant literature in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aVUXqSDKMgWAFVwmBe_403FhNa1M6eInFz3Ooj6oTIY/edit?usp=sharing). There is also a [bibtex file](https://github.com/awakenting/master-thesis/blob/master/manuscript/masterthesisbib.bib) in the "manuscript" folder. The bibtex file is more likely to be up to date. Feel free to add other papers if you think they're relevant, even if you don't have the time to fill all columns. It would be nice if you could put the paper in the correct row according to the last name of the first Author. Also, if you want, you can add your name in the "Contributor" column and I will acknowledge your contribution in the thesis.
